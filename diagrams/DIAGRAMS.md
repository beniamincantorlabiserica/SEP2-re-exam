# Diagrams folder

## Formatting
**For organisation purpose and ease of use, each diagram should be represented by the asta file and a render, both inside a directory with the name of the diagram.**

E.G:
- /diagrams/Class Diagram/Class Diagram.asta
- /diagrams/Class Diagram/Class Diagram.svg

> Don't forget to also export the diagram as .svg when committing a new version of an .asta file.

**The naming should use the standard naming of "x Diagram.asta" and "x Diagram.svg" where possible, where x is the name of the diagram starting with a capital letter.**
> If you edit a diagram, don't commit it as a "v2" of the previous diagram, instead commit it with the same name.
> e.g.: "Class Diagram.asta" remains "Class Diagram.asta", but in the version control, we can see the previous one easily.
